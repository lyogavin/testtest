    "A lot of people have looked at blending kernels and asked where the weights come from.  And the answer is usually something like, \"Intuition, after taking into account their public leaderboard scores and the correlations among their forecasts.\"  Understandably, people don't find that answer very satisfying.  So I made this notebook to show the elegant way of choosing blending weights.  I call it \"stacking\" instead of \"blending\" because it fits an explicit metamodel on top of the base models, but the distinction in meaning isn't clear cut.  Some will say it's still blending becuase the \"stacking model\" is linear and the validation data used to fit the weights are separate from the original training data.  (With k-fold validation, you could use out-of-fold predictions from the original training data, but k-fold validation may be the wrong approach given the time component in the data.)"

    "To train my stacker, I use logit transformations of each base model's validation predictions.  IMO this is the most straightforward way of doing it: my stacking model is a logistic regression, which takes a linear combination of its inputs and does a logistic (inverse logit) transformation on the result. It is essentially interpreting its inputs to be in units of logit (log odds) and then converting the result back into units of probability.\n\nBut you could also experiment with using other kinds of inputs.  Although the base models generate results that are nominally expressed as probabilities, they are mostly optimized for rank (i.e., using AUC) rather than probability value.  So in a sense they aren't *really* probabilities and maybe don't deserve to be treated as probabilities by having log odds taken.  Also, logit takes extreme predictions at face value, but maybe you don't trust the base models enough to believe their extreme predictions: maybe you want some regularization of the base model predicitons, and one way to get that regularization is to take the raw probabilities, or the ranks, instead of the logits."

And when you make changes, you shouldn't expect a close relationship between changes in the stacker score and changes in leaderboard score.  (One would expect them typically to move in the same direction, but there are a lot of exceptions.)  The stacker score will almost always be higher than the individual model CV scores, since the stacker could have chosen to use just one model.
